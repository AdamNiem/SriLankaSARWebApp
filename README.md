## About
This is a project made by our team during the 2025 NASA Space Apps Project. Made using Tailwind css, Nextjs, threejs, leaflet, https://jcallura.github.io/ (for topography stl model used) among other technologies. This was built on top of a fork of the [AnimateUI](https://animate-ui.com/docs) so the setup for the linter, pnpm, turbo among other is credited to that project by imskyleen (Elliot Sutton)
